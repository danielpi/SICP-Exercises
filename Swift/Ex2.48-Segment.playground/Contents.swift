// Exercise 2.48
// A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair of vectors - the vector running from the origin to the start-point of the segment, and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of the segment. Use your vector representation from Exercise 2.46 to define a representation for segments with a constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment.
