; Exercise: 2.81
; Louis Reasoner has noticed that apply-generic may try to coerce the arguments
; to each other's type even if they already have the same type. Therefore, he
; reasons, we need to put procedures in the coercion table to coerce arguments
; of each type to their own type. For example, in addition to the scheme-number-> complex
; coercion shown above, he would do:

(define (scheme-number->scheme-number n) n)
(define (complex->complex z) z)
(put-coercion 'scheme-number
              'scheme-number
              scheme-number->scheme-number)
(put-coercion 'complex 'complex complex-> complex)

; a. With Louis's coercion procedures installed, what happens if apply-generic is called
; with two arguments of type scheme-number or two arguments of type complex for an
; operation that is not found in the table for those types? For example, assume that
; we've defined a generic exponentiation operation:

(define (exp x y) (apply-generic 'exp x y))

; and have put a procedure for exponentiation in the Scheme-number package but not
; in any other package:

;; following added to Scheme-number package
(put 'exp '(scheme-number scheme-number)
     (lambda (x y) (tag (expt x y))))
     ; using primitive expt

; What happens if we call exp with two complex numbers as arguments?


; b. Is Louis correct that something had to be done about coercion with arguments
; of the same type, or does apply-generic work correctly as is?


; c. Modify apply-generic so that it doesn't try coercion if the two arguments have
; the same type.
